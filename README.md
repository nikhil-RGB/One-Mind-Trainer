### Purpose:
A deflection-trainer mod for the **"Ishhin Ashina"** boss fight from the 2019 triple-A game, **"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice"**.
The only move used will be Ishhin Ashina's **"One Mind"**, as it is extremely difficult to deflect all the hits unleashed perfectly.

### Description:
This mod forces **"Shura Ishhin"** to perform his signature move **"one mind"** multiple times in a row, with intermittent posture recovery animations to give the player time to recover posture/switch prosthetics/ready themselves for the next **"One Mind"** Combo.
This mod does not increase the base stats of Ishhin Ashina, and the posture recovery so performed does not give him any posture back, feel free to skip the deathblow if you'd like to keep practicing one-mind deflections.

### How to Launch: 

Download the mods.zip file and extract it's contents into a "mod" folder, put the mod folder into your main game directory, and ensure your **"modengine** is active and working correctly.
